# NAME

Paludis::ResumeState::Serialization - Work with resume-files generated by Paludis

# VERSION

version 0.01000410

# SYNOPSIS

    use Paludis::ResumeState::Serialization;

    open my $fh, '<' , '/resumefile' or die;

    my $objects = Paludis::ResumeState::Serialization->deserialize({
        content => ( do { local $/ = undef;  scalar <$fh> } ),
        format => 'basic'
    });

    my $content = Paludis::ResumeState::Serialization->serialize({
        data => $object,
        format => 'basic'
    });

    # $content should == contents of resumefile.

This class is just really a proxy serialization interface for a few of the varying back-ends.

Currently only the 'basic' back-end exists, which provides basic, but consistent serialization support.

## FormatNames

### basic

Defers serialization to [`::Basic`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Paludis::ResumeState::Serialization::Basic)

# METHODS

    my $object = ::Serialization->deserialize({
        content => $string
        format  => FormatName
    });
